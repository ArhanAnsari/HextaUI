## HextaUI - Modern UI Library

HextaUI is a user interface library that offers contemporary components, making it effortless to integrate into your projects. With the HextaUI CLI, you can quickly install and utilize these components without any hassle.

### Installation

To get started, simply run the following command:

```bash
npm install @hextastudio/ui@latest
```

After installation, use the HextaUI CLI by running:

```bash
npx hexta-ui <command>
```

### Commands

- `npx hexta-ui add <component_name>`: Add a component to your project.
- `npx hexta-ui list`: List all available components.
- `npx hexta-ui help`: Show the help message.

### Usage

1. To add a component, run:

```bash
npx hexta-ui add <component_name>
```

Replace `<component_name>` with the name of the component you want to install (e.g., `npx hexta-ui add button`). You can use lowercase or uppercase for the component name.

2. The CLI will download the selected component and place it in the `src/components/hexta-ui` directory of your project.

That's it! HextaUI makes it easy to enhance your user interface with modern, customizable components.
